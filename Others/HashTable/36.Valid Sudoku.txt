## Specification
Similar: LT37

Determine if a 9x9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following rules:
Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Each of the 9 3x3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.


## Ideas
The only difficulity for this problem is how to imple concisely. For each number in the 9x9 sudoku, we can fit it simultaneously to row, col, and box checking.

                }
        return true;
    }
};
