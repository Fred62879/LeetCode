*Example 1*:
Input:
words = ["This", "is", "an", "example", "of", "text", "justification."]
maxWidth = 16
Output:
["This    is    an",
 "example  of text",
 "justification.  "]

*Example 2*:
Input:
words = ["What","must","be","acknowledgment","shall","be"]
maxWidth = 16
Output:
["What   must   be",
 "acknowledgment  ",
 "shall be        "]
Explanation: Note that the last line is "shall be    " instead of "shall     be" because the last line must be left-justified instead of fully-justified. Note that the second line is also left-justified becase it contains only one word.

*Example 3*:
Input:
words = ["Science","is","what","we","understand","well","enough","to","explain",
         "to","a","computer.","Art","is","everything","else","we","do"]
maxWidth = 20
Output:
["Science  is  what we",
 "understand      well",
 "enough to explain to",
 "a  computer.  Art is",
 "everything  else  we",
 "do                  "]



["This    is   an",
 "example of text",
 "justification. "]

["This is an example of",
 "text justification.  "]
